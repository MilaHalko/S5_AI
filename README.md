# **Computer Workshop #1:** *Research of methods of formation of fuzzy sets and operations on them*
**Objective:** *To build fuzzy sets using different types of membership functions. Perform the most common logical operations on fuzzy sets.*

## :brain: Statement of the Task for Computer Workshop #1:
Construction of:
1) Triangular and trapezoidal membership functions
2) Simple and 2-combined Gaussian membership function 
3) "Generalized bell" function
4) Sigmoid functions: one-sided / product / difference
5) Z/S/PI-shaped functions
6) Logical operators' interpretation using minimum and maximum search operations
7) Conjunctive and disjunctive operators' interpretation
8) Negation of a fuzzy set
